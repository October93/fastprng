Implementation of the MARC and MaD0 Ultrafast High Quality Non-Cryptographic Pseudorandom Number Generator in Golang

**WARNING** This is not a full implementation yet. Basic MARC seems to work, but it hasn't been tested against reference test values.

Implementing MARC-bb (MARC as a building block), and then mad0 are next steps.

See the paper by Jie Li for the details on mad0 and MARC: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2875131.2856693
